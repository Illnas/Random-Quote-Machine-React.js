Random Quote Machine Project with React.js Hooks

So, here I am, after three days, I am finally done!

Now, this is very simple project, so why did it take me THREE DAYS to finish it?? Well, for almost three days I was messing on
fetch API part and the part where I was supposed to assign correct state to a prop before being able to 
render it properly. 

Now, that I did actually finish logical part of coding in less than 15 minutes because I realised where I was
making mistakes when I woke up this morning, well, now I am kicking myself. First mistake was: fetch call running
constantly and in meantime freezing VSC and browser! Had a lot of fun time with this one -.- Second mistake was:
assigning data from fetch api to props and then rendering that information. This one was solved pretty quickly since 
main problem was actually fetch api looping constantly.  But third and the biggest mistake was rushing to finish this
project as fast as possible since I already did it with JS. 

Good thing in this mess is: I actually did pretty amazing with all that git workflow stuff, which I mostly did
by copying it from The Odin Project workflow (git status, git add ., git commit -m ""). Now I will make repo with 
react-app already created so I can practice pulling and then pushing into a new repo.

Anyway, see ya in next project!


P.S. This is article that helped me with fetching API: "https://cobe.tech/blog/post/fetching-data-with-react-hooks-and-fetch-api-beginners"
